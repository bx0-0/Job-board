# Job-board


1. Django-based Job Board: The website is built on Django, a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications.
2. Authentication System: It incorporates an authentication system that allows users to register either as regular employees or as companies.
3. Job Posting: Companies have the ability to post job vacancies.
4. Job Application: Employees can apply for jobs. When an employee applies for a job, all their information is sent to the company via email.
5. Technical Posts: Employees can also post technical posts.
6. Interactive Features: The website features a comment system, likes, and the ability to reply to comments on posts.
7. Email Verification: In addition to Django's built-in authentication system, there's a feature that allows users to check their email and send a verification to it for confirmation, thus activating their email account.
